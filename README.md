# README

These scripts leverage John McFarlane's great [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) universal document converter. You'll need to have Pandoc installed before the scripts will function.

This is my first attempt at Ruby and scripting in general, so any pointers or advice is welcome. These are super-simple, so feel free to make them your own. Let me know what you come up with!
